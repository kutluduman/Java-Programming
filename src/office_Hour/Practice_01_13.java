         * Class = Type
         *
         *  In real world we have different types of Objects. Every object belongs to some kind of type.
         *
         *  In java everything is an object.
         *
         *  Every object has some properties and behaviors.
         *
         *  What is property?
         *
         *          Height, weight, color, name
         *
         *   and then what is behavior?
         *
         *      let's  say phone can ring, can make call, cant turn on, turn off, take pictures
         *
         *   any actions it's a behavior
         *
         *   So to be able to create objects with same properties and behavior, we need to list them in some
         *   kind of blueprint
         *
         *   To build millions of Toyota Camry, toyota needs some blueprint to make sure every car is identical.
         *
         *   In Java, we have class and class it's a blueprint of object.
         *
         *   Based on class we create objects.
         *
         *   Object, it's an instance of a class.
         *
         *   In Class, to create properties we use instance variables:
         *
         *                          class Person {
         *
         *                              private String firstName;  <------- they are instance variables
         *                              private String lastName;
         *                              private String DOB;
         *
         *
         *                          }
         *
         *  Instance variables always must be private
         *
         *  Every single object will have a copy of instance variables and methods
         *
         *  private means you cannot access this variable from outside
         *
         *  new class <----- this is how you create object
         */
