        //Create a program to calculate the final discounted price of an Item
        //
        //Create 3 double variables  called  regularPrice , salePrice and discount

        //Ask user question using scanner for regularPrice and discountPercentage
        //And save the result into the variable
        //
        //Calculate sale price using above information
        //For example :  80 regular price , 0.2 for discount  , salePrice â€”>> 64
        //
        //Print out  : regular price is 80$ , discount is 0.2  and your got deal for 64 $



        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in) ;

        if you have same kind of variables you can save line by:

        double regularPrice, salesPrice, discount ;

              System.out.println("What is the regular price?");
              regularPrice = scan.nextDouble();

            discount = scan.nextDouble();

            salePrice = regularPrice - regularPrice * discount ;

            System.out.println(" Regular price is " + regular price + " and the discount
            is " + discount + " so the final sale price is " + salesPrice);
